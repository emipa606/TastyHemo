**<ins>About:</ins>**
There was something wrong with Hemogenic Pawns requiring food for survival.
This mod makes Hemogenic Pawns capable of getting by on just Hemogen Packs.

**<ins>What this does:</ins>**


-  BloodFeed used on Living Pawns provides 1.0 * BodySize worth of Food. (~100% of Vanilla)
-  BloodFeed used on Living Pawns now gives the Biter a +8 mood buff, which can stack 5 times.




-  ~~Surgery to Extract Hemogen Packs no longer requires medicine, or anaesthetises the Pawn.~~ (Now Vanilla Behaviour)
-  Hemogen Packs provide 1.0 nutrition. (100% of Vanilla)
-  Hemogen Packs now give Hemogenic Pawns a +4 mood buff.



**<ins>Future Ideas?</ins>**


-  Options for everything
-  Modify StackLimit Option
-  Hemogenic Pawns prefer/seek Hemogen Packs
-  Food makes Hemogenic Pawns sick. (Food Poisoning) + Options
-  Extracting HemogenPacks or BloodFeeding from sick pawns will transfer the sickness to the Patient/Biter
